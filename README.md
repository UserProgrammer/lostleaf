## Level editor and Viewer at https://github.com/linux-man/lostleaf/releases

The concept is to guide a “leaf” through obstacles by tilting and creating objects.

I figured that this kind of game should have well designed levels, so I wrote a Level Editor and a Java version to test the levels.

The code is mostly done, and I created some basic levels to start.

I believe this game as potential, but I can’t continue alone. It’s time to share my work and find some interested people that would like to participate developing the game (new ideas, code, graphics, levels and debug).

Would you like to join?
